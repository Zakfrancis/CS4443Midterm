					back to the students. He teaches courses on operating systems and business systems programming.</td>
					<td>Mr. Robot is a world renown white hat hacker (mostly). He now teaches cryptography and network design
					to students looking for jobs in the security field.</td>
					<td>Professor Musk is still busy at work with his multiple ventures, but graciously teaches a few classes
					in his limited off time. He mainly teaches hands-on engineering courses and students love him because he
					gives the top student a Tesla at the end of each semester.</td>

					practical power of programming. His mainstay classes are computer archetecture and languages such as COBOL</td>
					<td>Professor Snowden sadly is limited to online classes only at this moment due to certain legal troubles. Don't
					let that dismay you though, he is a wonderful mind in the fields of cryptography and cyber security.</td>
					<td>Professor Bubbles is truly an awe inspiring professor. Once we were able to get him a waterproof keyboard, he
					started flourishing in our research department. At the rate he is going, he may have the solution to the next fastest 
					sorting algorithm. All we have to do is give him a fish every couple hundred lines of code!</td>
